Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on맖bservation마nd만xperimentation. For arelationist맚here can be no real difference between말nertial motion, in which the object travels with constant맜elocity, and맕on-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates맍orces, it must be absolute.[9]He used the example of망ater in a spinning bucket맚o demonstrate his argument.Water말n a막ucket말s hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.[10]Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.
