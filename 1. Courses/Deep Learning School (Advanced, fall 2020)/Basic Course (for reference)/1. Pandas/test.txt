The worst nightmare for any developer is to 
contact customer support for an internet problem. 
The customer service agents sometimes (I’m being polite, 
read ALWAYS) fail to understand that restarting computers
does not always work. Well, we’re developers and understand 
how these things work, so a lot of the time we know how to 
fix the problem, provided you connect us to a fellow developer.
SHIBBOLEET: I’m going to try it the next time I call any
 customer support service. I wish, someday, it comes true.
